She carries this giraffe with here everywhere.  I really score big points buying this for her.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"I bought Vulli ...\"}, \"Is it worth it?  With so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes, why is this one so popular?  Yes, it's trendy.  Yes, the celebrities all have these for their babies.  Yes, it's European.  But is it really worth the price for your baby?That's the question I've been asking myself ever since receiving Vulli Sophie the Giraffe as a gift from a well-meaning (and much-hipper-than-I-am) friend.  My answer is a qualified \\\"yes.\\\"  Here are the benefits.  This teether is several inches tall, making it larger than many other teethers.  Also, it has a lot of appendages (four legs and a long neck).  These features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether.  That's a big benefit.  Also, the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices.  My baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe's ears or nose.  I've seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs.  One baby I know even prefers to chew on the giraffe's rump.  With so many choices, your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes.  Additionally, the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed (think about a traditional dog squeaky toy).  My baby likes this sound (as do my dogs).  Finally, the all-rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean.  These are the benefits.Here are the downsides.  The rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn't thrilled about.  She's willing to put up with it, but I can tell that the taste isn't as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers.  Also, this teether doesn't have any rough patches or bumps, and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on.  Finally, this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost, and that's a big downside if you're buying this for your own baby.  So, weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Is it worth it? ...\"}, \"I ordered the two pack for two different grandbabies who will be born soon.

The rubber is softer and more pleasant to handle, and my daughter has enjoyed chewing on her legs and the nubs on her head even before she started teething.  She also loves the squeak that Sophie makes when you squeeze her.  Not sure what it is but if Sophie is amongst a pile of her other toys, my daughter will more often than not reach for Sophie.  And I have the peace of mind of knowing that only edible and safe paints and materials have been used to make Sophie, as opposed to Bright Starts and other baby toys made in China.  Now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys, I think it's more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths.  Sophie is a must-have for every new mom in my opinion.  Even if your kid is one of the few that can take or leave her, it's worth a try.

Plus, I think this little giraffe is just so cute.  Also, just as an anecdote: When I first offered Sophie to my daughter, she was NOT interested.  The squeak was a bit loud for her, and the natural rubber taste was different for her.  I thought I may have wasted $18.  However, over time, my daughter has really come to like Sophie.

My baby got thrush when she was only 2 weeks old and I had to sterilize everything that came in contact with her mouth.  What would I have done with this then?  And she just got over her first cold, so again everything was sterilized.  You need to sterilize things with a baby- you just do.

Every other toy is an eyesore.- The squeak is slightly annoying (like any squeak toy) but it really does make my baby smile when we are out and he gets fussy- The rubber is soft enough that my baby can chew on it without injuring himself and not too soft to puncture (the chewing sound does make a rubbing rubber sound that makes me cringe, but baby loves it).- The &#34;small&#34; parts, I like that the legs, neck and head are small enough for my baby to grab and chew on without being too small.CONS:- Slightly expensive, but worth it in my opinion.- Another mom friend said that the squeak sounds similar to that of her dog's toys so the dog likes to play with this too.  Having two (2) dogs that love squeak toys I am amazed that my dogs have not touched this toy.- I wish there were real instructions (not just vague information on the box) concerning cleaning.

The paint seemed to be on the plastic and did not seem to rub off; the plastic seems to be good quality in that it is very thick and durable for hard chewers.

It seemed to get dislodged because we could feel it inside and it felt like it came out of place but we couldn't fix it.

So, when I read the reviews for Sophie, I figured all these people couldn't be wrong. When I first got her, I was glad that Sophie is not hard, inflexible rubber, which she looks like from the picture. She is much softer, like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy, which some people have already commented on. My thoughts regarding Sophie's likeness to a dog toy is not a far-fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds. Our dog LOVES this thing! I have to hide it, but he goes sniffing for it. Anyway, when our son first got his hands on this thing, it went straight into his mouth. And he smiles every time Sophie squeaks, which is so cute to see. He also smiles when he \\\"gums\\\" Sophie's body, especially her legs (hooves, actually). So, judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth, and smiles when he does so, I'd say she was a worthwhile purchase, but it is very pricey, nonetheless, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's handmade, made of natural rubber (from the sap of the Havea tree), hand-painted with food grade colors, and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete. It's been around since 1961 (or 65, I can't remember)and hasn't changed since. But even though she'll be a keepsake, the price is exaggerated.

My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible.

If your baby likes Sophie, she will be a great toy.  If not, hey, give Sophie away to another mom to try with her baby.  Also, I think trying a toy over and over again may help.  My little girl didn't quite get Sophie right away at four months, but I kept putting Sophie in front of her and encouraging her by sticking one of Sophie's legs in her mouth.

       "\"Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09\""

       "\"I'm not sure why Sophie is such a hit with the little ones, but my 7 month old baby girl is one of her adoring fans.  The rubber is softer and more pleasant to handle, and my daughter has enjoyed chewing on her legs and the nubs on her head even before she started teething.  She also loves the squeak that Sophie makes when you squeeze her.  Not sure what it is but if Sophie is amongst a pile of her other toys, my daughter will more often than not reach for Sophie.  And I have the peace of mind of knowing that only edible and safe paints and materials have been used to make Sophie, as opposed to Bright Starts and other baby toys made in China.  Now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys, I think it's more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths.  Sophie is a must-have for every new mom in my opinion.  Even if your kid is one of the few that can take or leave her, it's worth a try.  Vulli, the makers of Sophie, also make natural rubber teething rings that my daughter loves as well.\""

       "\"My son (now 2.5) LOVED his Sophie, and I bought one for every baby shower I've gone to. Now, my daughter (6 months) just today nearly choked on it and I will never give it to her again. Had I not been within hearing range it could have been fatal. The strange sound she was making caught my attention and when I went to her and found the front curved leg shoved well down her throat and her face a purply/blue I panicked. I pulled it out and she vomited all over the carpet before screaming her head off. I can't believe how my opinion of this toy has changed from a must-have to a must-not-use. Please don't disregard any of the choking hazard comments, they are not over exaggerated!\""

Also, if it is soiled it is extremely difficult to clean as the rubber is a kind of porus material and does not clean well. The final thing is the squeaking device inside which stopped working after the first couple of days. I returned this item feeling I had overpaid for a toy that was defective and did not meet my expectations. Please do not be swayed by the cute packaging and hype surounding it as I was. One more thing, I was given a full refund from Amazon without any problem.\""
