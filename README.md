# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Specialization-University-of-Washington-
This repository stores my exercises from modules 1 and 2 of the UW - ML specialization. The exercises are written in Python but in order to run them in your dev environment you either need the Scikit Machine Learning tools or the Dato application. IMO, I used the Dato app because it contains many of the Scikit tools and it runs on different browsers (except for IE whatever version, please avoid it). 
Please, feel free to modify any of the existing lines of code or even study them in order to pass one of the mentioned modules ;)
P.D.: I am done with this specialization and I won't continue working on it.
